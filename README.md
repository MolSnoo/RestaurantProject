# RestaurantProject

The Restaurant Reservation System allows a user to make a table reservation at a restaurant online with a web application. This web app includes a menu of food sold by the restaurant, a home page, and a reservation page with which a user can reserve a table with a variable party size, at a time and day of their choosing. This project is built with Angular for the frontend, and Spring for the backend.
